Cloaked provides a simple mechanism to help obfuscate ActiveRecord ids and/or other database attributes by generating public keys that can be used and made publicly visible.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cloaked'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cloaked

## Usage

Cloaked needs to be included in your model:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include Cloaked
end
```

After including it in the model, you can specify the list of public keys for which you want to generate public keys:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include Cloaked

  with_cloaked_keys :public_id
end
```

By default, cloak will generate a random URL-safe base64 of 8 bytes. You can specify a different method for generating the public keys:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include Cloaked

  with_cloaked_keys :public_id, method: :hex 
end
```

Will generate a random hexadecimal string with 16 characters.

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include Cloaked

  with_cloaked_keys :public_id, method: :uuid 
end
```

Will generate a v4 random UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier).

You can specify a custom length:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include Cloaked

  with_cloaked_keys :public_id, size: 16
end
```

Only applies to `:base64` and `hex`. Note that in the latter case, the length of the hexadecimal string will be twice the size amount.
